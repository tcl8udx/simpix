INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUDENT CODE
============================
The script to execute simpix is simpix.py. To run, it has the same usage as the starter code:
python simpix.py image1 image2 <output=out.png>

As for the images used in the submission, there are four which are used to make two pairs:
* BusyStreet.jpg
* Mound.jpg
* Oasis.jpg
* Street.jpg

From these pairs we construct four transposed images, which took these times to create: 
* BusyMound.jpg ,  time = 74.30 seconds
* MoundBusy.jpg ,  time = 58.20 seconds
* OasisStreet.jpg ,  time = 50.91 seconds
* StreetOasis.jpg ,  time = 51.77 seconds
